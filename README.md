# Estimation of Obesity Levels Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

This project aims to estimate obesity levels by leveraging a semi-supervised machine learning approach. It addresses the common challenge of limited labeled data in health datasets by combining unsupervised and supervised learning techniques.

The methodology integrates K-Means clustering with three supervised classification models—Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost—to enhance prediction accuracy. After evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its superior performance and robustness across classes.

Additionally, the project includes an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes cluster trends, model predictions, and health behavior patterns. This enables data-driven insights for healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and the general public.
