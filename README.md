# Project Overview

Estimation of Obesity Levels Using Semi-Supervised Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting obesity levels by integrating semi-supervised learning techniques to address the challenge of limited labelled data. The approach combines unsupervised K-Means clustering with supervised classification models to improve prediction accuracy and generate meaningful health insights.

Three supervised models were evaluated in this study: Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost. After comparing performance across metrics such as accuracy and F1-score, Random Forest was selected as the final model due to its superior classification performance and robustness.

The project also features an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes clustering patterns, model predictions, and trends in health-related behaviors, enabling actionable insights for healthcare practitioners and policymakers as well as the general public.
